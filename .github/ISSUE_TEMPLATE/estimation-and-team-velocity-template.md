## 📊 Agile Progress Overview  

| Release | Total User Stories | Total Story Points | Estimated Sprints |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
|    #     |         #          |         #          |      # – #        |

> 💡 *Use this table to summarize your release estimation.*

## 📈 Prediction  

- **Required Iterations:** 0 – 0 Sprints  
- **Team Velocity:** 0 – 0 Story Points per Sprint  
- **Sprint Duration:** 0 Days  
- **Estimated Release:** 0 – 0 Days  
- **Assumption:** The team completes **0 – 0 Story Points** every **0 Days**, leading to an estimated release within **0 – 0 Days** from the start date.

> 🧮 *Example:*  
> Team velocity = 30 SP / sprint → 120 total SP → 4 sprints → 2 weeks per sprint → ≈ 8 weeks total.

## 🧠 Estimation Formula Reference  

1. **Calculate total story points (S)** 
2. **Get average team velocity (T)** per iteration 
3. **Compute iterations (I)**  

  - I = S / T

4. **Get average time per iteration (A)**  

  - A = sprint length (in days/weeks)

5. **Estimate total delivery time (W)**
   
  - W = I × A

7. Express **W** in days, weeks, or months as appropriate.

## 📘 Fibonacci Reminder  

**Standard Fibonacci Sequence (2-term):**  
0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...

**Modified Fibonacci Sequence (3-term):**  
0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, ...

> 💬 *Tip:* Use Fibonacci sequences for story point estimation in agile planning poker sessions.

## 📝 Notes  

- Maintain consistency in estimation.  
- Update velocity after each sprint to improve accuracy.  
- Keep a historical log of sprint velocities for predictive analytics.  
- Align estimation discussions with Definition of Done (DoD).
