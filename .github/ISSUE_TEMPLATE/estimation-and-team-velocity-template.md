## Theme
- [Release #]()

## Agile Progress Overview

| Release    | Total User Stories | Total Story Points | Estimated Sprints |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
|    #       |          # ([Sprint 1](), [Sprint 2](), [Sprint 3]())        |        #         |       # to #      |

## Prediction
- Required Iterations: # to # Sprints
- Team Velocity: # to # Story Points per Sprint
- Sprint Duration: # Days
- Estimated Release: # to # Days
- Assumption: The team completes # to # Story Points every # days, with an estimated release within # to # days from the starting date.

## Note

- Calculate the number of story points (S) per iteration
- Get average team velocity (T)
- S/T = Iterations (I) to do
- Get average time per iteration (A)
- I * A = Get Estimated Time (W)
- W = Days, Weeks, Months, Years...

## Reminder

The traditional Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is obtained by adding the two preceding terms:

- 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

In the Modified Fibonacci sequence, we start with three initial terms instead of two, and each subsequent term is calculated by summing up the three preceding terms:

- 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, ...
