## 🧭 SCRUM Milestones

Milestones in any project represent **the lifecycle of an idea** — from concept to delivery. They serve as organizational containers to track the maturity of work items as they move through **Theme → Epic → Brief → User Story → Completion**.

Each milestone defines a **stage of refinement**. Issues or user stories should move through these stages as they evolve from high-level goals to implementable tasks.

### 🧱 Milestone Reference Table

| Milestone | Purpose | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Theme** | Ideation | The items in this milestone represent the general objective ideas of the project itself. They await refinement into an Epic, then a Brief, and finally a User Story. |
| **Epic** | Structuring | When the idea is still too broad, items will be temporarily stored in this milestone for discussion and potential splitting into other Epics, in preparation for Briefing or refining a User Story. |
| **Brief** | Preparation | In this milestone, we create a briefing for the User Story to prepare for a meeting or refinement session. Once approved, these items move to the **User Story** milestone for organization into iterations and implementation. |
| **User Story** | Implementation | After passing through the necessary filters, we store the final User Stories or implementations required for the project. These include acceptance criteria and tasks. Once completed, they move to the “Closed” section. |
| **Defects** | Quality Control | In case business stakeholders or testers find a defect, it will be logged here for triage and inclusion in an upcoming iteration or patch release. |

### 🔄 Typical Workflow

1. **Theme** → initial idea or goal  
2. **Epic** → grouped concept, potentially split into smaller efforts  
3. **Brief** → preparation and clarification for development  
4. **User Story** → actionable, sprint-ready items with criteria  
5. **Defects** → captured and resolved in future sprints  

### 📘 Tips for Use

- Keep milestones focused: each should reflect a **clear phase of progress**, not an individual task.  
- Close milestones only after all contained issues are either completed or reclassified.
- Review milestones during sprint reviews or release planning to maintain project clarity.
